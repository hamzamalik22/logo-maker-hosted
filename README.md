# Logo Maker (hosted)

Simple single-file static demo for creating or previewing logos.

**Project structure**
- `index.html`: Main static page containing the logo maker UI and logic.

**Quick start**
- Open the app in your browser by double-clicking `index.html` or serving the folder with a simple HTTP server:

```bash
# from the project root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

**Features**
- No build tools or dependencies — just a static HTML file.
- Works offline once the files are on disk or served locally.

**Development**
- Edit `index.html` to update styles, layout, or behavior.
- Use your browser devtools for quick debugging.
